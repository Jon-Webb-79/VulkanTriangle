VulkanTriangle
**************
This repository stores a simple code base that prints a triangle to the 
screen using the Vulkan graphics API.  The primary purpose of this repository 
is to show the basic code that can be re-used in more complex projects and 
to store an example of the CMakeLists.txt file that is used to build GLFW
from scratch using X11 extensions, and to build the Vulkan code into an
executable
